# Store-Waiting-Queue-Management-System
Description:
This C++ project simulates and manages a waiting queue for customers at a store. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle customer flow using basic data structures and object-oriented programming principles. The system allows for the addition of new customers to the queue, removal of customers once they are served, and the display of the current queue status.
Key Features:
•	Add customers to the waiting queue
•	Serve (remove) customers from the front of the queue
•	View the current list of waiting customers
•	Optionally, assign timestamps or priority levels for more advanced queue handling
Technologies Used:
•	C++ (Standard Template Library – especially queue or custom implementations)
•	Console-based interface
•	Optional: File handling for logging or storing queue data
Purpose:
The project is designed to demonstrate the use of queues in real-world scenarios, improve understanding of data structures, and provide a foundational tool for store or service point queue management.
